## 🚀 Overview

This page documents the process of publishing a simple website using:

- **Quarto** (to generate HTML)
- **GitHub Desktop** (to manage files)
- **GitHub Pages** (to host the website)

No manual HTML coding or command-line tools are required.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A **GitHub account**
- **RStudio**
- **Quarto** (RStudio will prompt you if it’s missing)
- **GitHub Desktop**

---

## 📝 Step 1: Create a Quarto Document

1. Open **RStudio**
2. Go to **File → New File → Quarto Document**
3. Choose:
   - Output format: **HTML**
   - Title: anything you want
4. Click **Create**
5. Save the file as:


> This filename is important — GitHub Pages looks for an `index.html` file as the homepage.

---

## 🔄 Step 2: Render Quarto to HTML

1. With `index.qmd` open in RStudio, click **Render**
2. Quarto will generate:


3. A preview of your webpage should appear automatically.

---

## 🗂 Step 3: Create a GitHub Repository (GitHub Desktop)

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Click **File → New repository**
3. Enter:
   - Repository name (e.g. `Test_HTML`)
   - Choose a local folder
4. Click **Create repository**

This creates a local project folder connected to GitHub.

---

## 📁 Step 4: Add Your Website Files

1. Open the repository folder on your computer
2. Copy these files into it:
   - `index.html` ✅ (required)
   - `index.qmd` (recommended)

3. Return to **GitHub Desktop**
4. You should see the files listed under **Changes**

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit & Push Files

1. In GitHub Desktop, write a commit message like:


2. Click **Commit to main**
3. Click **Push origin**

Your files are now uploaded to GitHub.

---

## 🌍 Step 6: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open your repository on **github.com**
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

GitHub will begin publishing your site.

---

## 🔗 Step 7: View Your Website

After 1–2 minutes, your site will be available at:


If the page does not load immediately, refresh after a short wait.

---

## 🔁 Updating the Website

To update the site later:

1. Edit `index.qmd` in RStudio
2. Click **Render**
3. Open GitHub Desktop
4. Commit the updated files
5. Click **Push origin**

The website will update automatically.

---

## 🧠 How This Works (Conceptually)

- `index.qmd` → source file
- Rendering → creates `index.html`
- GitHub Pages → hosts `index.html` as a website

Workflow summary:

**Edit → Render → Commit → Push → Published**

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### ❌ 404 Error
- Confirm `index.html` exists
- Ensure it is in the **root** of the repository
- Check spelling and capitalization (must be lowercase)

### ❌ Changes not showing
- Re-render the file
- Commit and push again
- Hard refresh the browser

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] `index.html` is in the repository root
- [ ] Repository is public
- [ ] GitHub Pages is enabled
- [ ] Website URL loads correctly

---

## 🎉 Done

Once the site loads successfully, submit the GitHub Pages URL.
